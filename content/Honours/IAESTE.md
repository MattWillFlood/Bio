In 2012, I was fortunate to participate in the IAESTE student exchange programme at the Radio Engineering Dept., Aalto University, Finland.
As part of the programme, I spent the summer living and working on the Aalto university campus in Otaniemi, Espoo.
This programme provided an invaluable experience for me to develop technical skills related to my undergraduate studies in electronic engineerings,
while at the same time, immersing myself in a foreign country and culture with a network of students from around the world.

> `About IAESTE`    
The *International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience* (IAESTE) program was established in the aftermath of World War II
in order for the international community to foster global understanding and co-operation. 
Today, the worldwide IAESTE network incoporates nearly 90 countries, organising paid, course-related traineeships for students and recent graduates of technical subjects such as Engineering, Science, Architecture and IT. A huge variety of employers, from multinationals to universities to start-ups, offer traineeships through IAESTE. 
IAESTE aims is to enhance participants’ professional, technical and intercultural skills — while providing employers with well-qualified and highly motivated trainees.
