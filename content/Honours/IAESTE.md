> About IASETE     
The International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE)   
In the aftermath of World War II, a new spirit pervaded the world: a desire for international understanding and co-operation. It was this spirit that brought forth both the United Nations (UN) and IAESTE, organisations dedicated to promoting these objectives. Today we believe that students with international experience are the key to tackling today's global challenges.
