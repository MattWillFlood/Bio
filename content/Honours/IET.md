In 2014, I won the national [`Present Around the World [PATW]`](https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/awards-scholarships/iet-present-around-the-world-competition/) competition hosted by the Institution of Engineering & Technology (IET) Ireland network. I was fortunate to subsequently represent Ireland at the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) round of the competition, also held in Dublin.

> The PATW is a global competition hosted by the IET for students in engineering to demonstrate their public speaking and communication skills.
My presentation, "Engineering the Brain - Decoding Our Thoughts", outlined the research behind my Master's project on multi-class brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). 

With major developments in machine learning research and the ever-increasing availability of powerful consumer technology, BCIs are becoming more impressive year on year.
These advances have been most evident in the field of biomedical engineering, where BCIs have [demonstrated promising results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497935/) as assistive devices for neurorehabilitation.
As industries begin to integrate biofeedback into all manner of consumer products, opportunities to harness the utility of BCIs [will become more patent](https://www.rand.org/blog/articles/2020/08/brain-computer-interfaces-are-coming-will-we-be-ready.html).

However, [many hurdles remain](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-84996-272-8_3) to be overcome as we seek to identify robust ways of capturing neurophysiological signals in a noisy world where data is often corrupted by motion artefacts and equipment remains expensive for accurate consumer wearbales.
