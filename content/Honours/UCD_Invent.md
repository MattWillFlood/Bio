With my co-inventors Prof. Madeleine Lowery and Dr. Ben O'Callaghan, we received the 2019 NovaUCD Invention of the Year prize for our project `Handalysis`.
The Handalysis device germinated from our project at the Royal Hospital Donnybrook, where we used wearable sensors (accelerometers) to capture and quantify various clinical assessments of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Finger tapping tests are commonly employed by therapists and clinicians to determine the degree of manual dexterity and fine motor control, which diminishes over time as PD progresses.
The Handalysis system could be instrumental in providing an objective assessment for clinicians in order to gauge the rate of disease progression as manifested by finger tapping.
