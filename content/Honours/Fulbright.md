In 2017, I was awarded the NUI-Fulbright Visiting Researcher Scholarship to undertake a part of my PhD in the [`Motion Analysis Lab`](https://spauldingrehab.org/research/programs-labs/motion-analysis), at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Harvard Medical School, MA, USA.   
Under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Bonato, the research I conducted during my stay included developing a novel assistive exoskeleton and assessing bilateral upper limb activity in individuals with acute stroke.


> The Fulbright Program is one of the longest running cultural exchange programs in the United States, established in 1946 by J. William Fulbright.  
The program provides grants for scholars to undertake research, teach or exercise their talents at institutions across the USA.
Central to the program is the exchange of cultural ideas and values, with Fulbrighters acting as ambassadors for the home country.  
[60 Fulbright alumni have won Nobel Prizes; 89 have won Pulitzer Prizes; 37 have been heads of government](https://eca.state.gov/fulbright/fulbright-alumni/notable-fulbrighters).
