I was a winner of the Best Paper prize at the 2015 Insight Student Conferece held the NUI Galway.
My paper presented the early stage results of our [collaborative project](sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245718313853) with researchers at the University of Copenhagen 
to use nonlinear methods to analyse surface electromyography in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease toward the development of quantiative biomarkers.
