&lt;p>This project aims to answer 3 questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Does the kayaking technique of elite athletes, quantified from wearable IMU/EMG data using nonlinear methods, relate to specific muscle control strategies and overall performance?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do individuals with movement disorders (geriatrics, neurodegenerative disease, etc.) improve their motor and respiratory function from a regimen of regular kayak ergometry exercises?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can the methods used to answer Q.1 capture adaptations in motor performance in the groups of Q.2?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Part 1 of this project will be conducted in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/128011">Prof. Mathias Kristiansen&lt;/a> and his team at the University of Aalborg, Denmark. &lt;br>
Part 2 will be conducted locally in partnership with neurologist &lt;a href="https://researchportal.lih.lu/en/persons/deborah-mcintyre">Dr Deborah McIntyre&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>About the &lt;code>Wolfgang Baertz Award&lt;/code>&lt;br>
Following a generous donation by the late Mr Wolfgang Baertz in support of its research activities, LIH has set up a career launchpad award to fund postdoctoral fellows through €10,000 scholarships. &lt;br>
The initiative aims to support young researchers in finalising or initiating a promising and innovative research project, thus helping launch their careers. &lt;br>
The grant may be used to carry out additional experiments which could lead to a scientific breakthrough, or to generate preliminary findings to enable the awardee to establish his/her own research line. &lt;br>
This could include travelling to a renowned laboratory to allow the applicant to learn new techniques, develop research skills, bridge the gap between research and practice, initiate third-party funded projects and consolidate his professional network.&lt;/p>

With my co-inventors Prof. Madeleine Lowery and Dr. Ben O&amp;rsquo;Callaghan, we received the 2019 NovaUCD Invention of the Year prize for our project Handalysis. The Handalysis device germinated from our project at the Royal Hospital Donnybrook, where we used wearable sensors (accelerometers) to capture and quantify various clinical assessments of individuals with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Finger tapping tests are commonly employed by therapists and clinicians to determine the degree of manual dexterity and fine motor control, which diminishes over time as PD progresses.</description><content>&lt;blockquote>

Finger tapping tests are commonly employed by therapists and clinicians to determine the degree of manual dexterity and fine motor control, which diminishes over time as PD progresses.
The Handalysis system could be instrumental in providing an objective assessment for clinicians in order to gauge the rate of disease progression as manifested by finger tapping.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The PATW is a global competition hosted by the IET for students in engineering to demonstrate their public speaking and communication skills.
My presentation, &amp;ldquo;Engineering the Brain - Decoding Our Thoughts&amp;rdquo;, outlined the research behind my Master&amp;rsquo;s project on multi-class brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>With major developments in machine learning research and the ever-increasing availability of powerful consumer technology, BCIs are becoming more impressive year on year.
These advances have been most evident in the field of biomedical engineering, where BCIs have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497935/">demonstrated promising results&lt;/a> as assistive devices for neurorehabilitation.
As industries begin to integrate biofeedback into all manner of consumer products, opportunities to harness the utility of BCIs &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/articles/2020/08/brain-computer-interfaces-are-coming-will-we-be-ready.html">will become more patent&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-84996-272-8_3">many hurdles remain&lt;/a> to be overcome as we seek to identify robust ways of capturing neurophysiological signals in a noisy world where data is often corrupted by motion artefacts and equipment remains expensive for accurate consumer wearbales.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;code>About IAESTE&lt;/code> &lt;br>
The &lt;em>International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience&lt;/em> (IAESTE) program was established in the aftermath of World War II
in order for the international community to foster global understanding and co-operation.
Today, the worldwide IAESTE network incoporates nearly 90 countries, organising paid, course-related traineeships for students and recent graduates of technical subjects such as Engineering, Science, Architecture and IT. A huge variety of employers, from multinationals to universities to start-ups, offer traineeships through IAESTE.
IAESTE aims is to enhance participants’ professional, technical and intercultural skills — while providing employers with well-qualified and highly motivated trainees.&lt;/p>
